#### WHAT IS bWOKE?
Influencer culture has not only helped promote brands but larger social issues and charities that celebrities are passionate about. Historically, donations from individuals account for over two-thirds of all donations. If you add in gifts from bequests, then the category accounts for nearly 80% of all giving. In other words, the donating public, not big foundations or corporations, is responsible for the vast majority of annual donations. 

Many people in today’s world have a hard time knowing what a good first step to social activism or giving back is. As a team, we are aiming to create measurable change by giving people an easy tool to find causes close to their hearts and close to their homes. The added layer of also identifying celebrity endorsements for charities mixes personal passion and pop culture by connecting everyday folks to people they admire in hopes of creating larger social change through already established followings.
